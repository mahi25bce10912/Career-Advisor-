Overview - Choosing a career is one of the biggest decisions a student has to make, yet it often feels confusing and overwhelming. Many students are unsure about what they are good at or which path matches their abilities. A Career Recommendation System Based on Academic Strengths helps make this process simpler and more meaningful by using a student’s subject-wise performance to offer suitable career suggestions.
The idea is easy to understand. Every student has unique talents, and these naturally show up in their academic results. Some students may find math and problem-solving easy, while others may do better in science, languages, social sciences, or creative subjects. These strengths can give a clear indication of the types of careers where a student is likely to perform well and feel satisfied. Instead of choosing a career based on pressure, trends, or guesswork, students can rely on a more logical and helpful method.
In this system, the student’s marks or grades are taken as input. The program looks at the subjects where the student performs best and matches these strengths with related career fields. For instance, strong scores in math and programming may point toward engineering or computer science, while high performance in language and communication may suggest careers such as journalism, law, teaching, or public relations.
By offering suggestions that align with a student’s natural strengths, the system helps them make clearer, more confident, and well-informed career choices. It acts as a simple yet powerful tool that supports students in planning a future that suits their abilities and interests.
